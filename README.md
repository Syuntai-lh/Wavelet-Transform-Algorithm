## Wavelet-Transform-Algorithm
Wavelet Transform (WT) hybrid Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Develop for non-linear models predicition.


#### Dependecies
 - Matlab R2017b - (Machine Learning Models) ANN,RF and MLR
 
 #### What the project does?
Input data sequence with a set of functions generated by the mother wavelet. 
The convolution can be computed by using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.
